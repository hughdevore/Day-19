# Day-19

Create a backbone todo list using Backbone Models and Collections. 
The todo list should allow you to add todo items from an input text box. 
You should then be able to mark todo items as complete by clicking on a button next to them. 
Marking them as complete should not remove them. Instead, it should put a strikethrough through them.

Hard mode: Add a search box that will filter your todo items by a RegEx string.

Nightmare mode: Create a way to save your todo list using Tiny Pizza Server.
